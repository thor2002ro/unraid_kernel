	---help---
	  Device-mapper is a low level volume manager.  It works by allowing
	  people to specify mappings for ranges of logical sectors.  Various
	  mapping types are available, in addition people may write their own
	  modules containing custom mappings if they wish.

	  Higher level volume managers such as LVM2 use this driver.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be

	  the ciphers you're going to use in the cryptoapi configuration.

	  For further information on dm-crypt and userspace tools see:

       ---help---
         dm-cache attempts to improve performance of a block device by
         moving frequently used data to a smaller, higher performance
         device.  Different 'policy' plugins can be used to change the
         algorithms used to select which blocks are promoted, demoted,
         cleaned etc.  It supports writeback and writethrough modes.

config DM_CACHE_SMQ

       default y
       ---help---
         A cache policy that uses a multiqueue ordered by recent hits
         to select which blocks should be promoted and demoted.
         This is meant to be a general purpose policy.  It prioritises
         reads over writes.  This SMQ policy (vs MQ) offers the promise
         of less memory utilization, improved performance and increased
         adaptability in the face of changing workloads.

config DM_WRITECACHE

	   The writecache target caches writes on persistent memory or SSD.
	   It is intended for databases or other programs that need extremely
	   low commit latency.

	   The writecache target doesn't cache reads because reads are supposed
	   to be cached in standard RAM.

         vendor snapshots.

config DM_MIRROR
       tristate "Mirror target"
       depends on BLK_DEV_DM
       ---help---

config DM_LOG_USERSPACE

	---help---
	  The userspace logging module provides a mechanism for
	  relaying the dm-dirty-log API to userspace.  Log designs
	  which are more suited to userspace implementation (e.g.
	  shared storage logs) or experimental logs can be implemented
	  by leveraging this framework.

       ---help---
	 A dm target that supports RAID1, RAID10, RAID4, RAID5 and RAID6 mappings

	 A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive provides
	 the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
	 of a single drive. For a given sector (row) number, (N - 1) drives
	 contain data sectors, and one drive contains the parity protection.
	 For a RAID-4 set, the parity blocks are present on a single drive,
	 while a RAID-5 set distributes the parity across the drives in one
	 of the available parity distribution methods.

	 A RAID-6 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive
	 provides the capacity of C * (N - 2) MB, and protects
	 against a failure of any two drives. For a given sector
	 (row) number, (N - 2) drives contain data sectors, and two
	 drives contains two independent redundancy syndromes.  Like
	 RAID-5, RAID-6 distributes the syndromes across the drives
	 in one of the available parity distribution methods.

config DM_ZERO

	depends on BLK_DEV_DM
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HASH
	select DM_BUFIO
	---help---
	  This device-mapper target creates a read-only device that
	  transparently validates the data on one underlying device against
	  a pre-generated tree of cryptographic checksums stored on a second
	  device.

	  You'll need to activate the digests you're going to use in the
	  cryptoapi configuration.

	  The path used for any specific region can be switched dynamically
	  by sending the target a message.

	  be called dm-switch.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DM_LOG_WRITES

	depends on BLK_DEV_DM
	---help---
	  This device-mapper target takes two devices, one device to use
	  normally, one to log all write operations done to the first device.
	  This is for use by file system developers wishing to verify that
	  their fs is writing a consistent file system at all times by allowing
	  them to replay the log in a variety of ways and to check the
	  contents.

	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called dm-log-writes.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  block device and exposes most of its capacity as a regular block
	  device (drive-managed zoned block device) without any write
	  constraints. This is mainly intended for use with file systems that
	  do not natively support zoned block devices but still want to
	  benefit from the increased capacity offered by SMR disks. Other uses
	  by applications using raw block devices (for example object stores)
	  are also possible.

	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called dm-zoned.

	  If unsure, say N.
